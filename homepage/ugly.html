    <p>C++ is the best language in the world!</p>
    <p>Java is absolutely trash!</p>
    <p>Python is a script language!</p>
    <p>C is the prototype of C++?</p>
    <p>Front end is a disaster!</p>

      <p> This is the personal webpage of Yuqi Zhang.<br> He is in the poor Computing Science Department which could not open all courses each year. <br> </p>
      <p> C++ and java are used by Yuqi better than other horrible languages.<br> Emmm wait!<br> Are you expecting to hear about Python? <br> </p>
      <p> I'm sorry to inform you that Python is only a script,<br> at least in my opinion.<br> Comparing to C++ It's not a real OOP language :).  <br> </p>
  <p> Some contents here</p>

        <h3> Game AI!</h3>
          <p>This is what my teammates and I did in CMPUT350.<br> I've learned much more about OOP than 301.<br> Tons of things are taught in 301 such as documentation, modular program etc.<br> </p>
          <p>But only when I work with my own program and try splitting big files into smaller baby files in 350.<br> I realized the true meanning of them. Those pains from reading thousands of lines of code just for one simple correction and read several depths of function call would never be forgotten by I.</p>

        <h3> Android Project</h3>
          <p>Cool project. Thanks to Kenny, we had a heavy workload.<br> Thanks for my teammates, we got almost full marks when we were having a mean TA.</p>
          <p><br>I love elastic DB and back end.</p>
